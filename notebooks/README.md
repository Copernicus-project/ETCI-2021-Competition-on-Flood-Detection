## About the notebooks

* `Apply_CRF.ipynb`: Applies Conditional Random Fields [1] as a post-processing step with the [`pydensecrf` library](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf). 
* `Data_Viz.ipynb`: Data visualization notebook ([Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sidgan/ETCI-2021-Competition-on-Flood-Detection/blob/main/notebooks/Data_Viz.ipynb)).
* `Ensemble_Inference.ipynb`: Creates inference with an ensemble. 
* `Generate_Pseudo.ipynb`: Prepares pseudo labels.

**Note** that apart from the `Data_Viz.ipynb` notebook, we don't recommend running the other notebooks on Google Colab.
